Answer 10:
    The changes I made online were not reflected in my local copy. Locally it does not show the update. 

Answer 11:
    An error occurs ! [rejected] and it fails to push to github. It provides a hint saying that this rejection is because the remote contains work that I do not have locally. Since I do not have the latest file (my information is behind and does not match the online repo) it will not let me commit.

Answer 12:
    Yes, the changes I made online are now shown in my local file.

Answer 13:
    .   ..   .git.  .gitignore   README.md
